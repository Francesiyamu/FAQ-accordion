# FAQ accordion
 This project is a FAQ Accordion Component built as part of a coding challenge from Frontend Mentor. It is designed to display frequently asked questions (FAQs) in an interactive accordion format, where users can expand or collapse individual questions to reveal or hide their answers.

Key Features:
Accordion Functionality:

Each FAQ question has a button with a plus icon (+) that toggles the visibility of the corresponding answer.
When the button is clicked, the plus icon changes to a minus icon (-), and the answer becomes visible.
Clicking the button again hides the answer and reverts the icon back to a plus.
Responsive Design:

The project includes a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
A media query for devices with a max-width: 375px is already implemented, and additional media queries (e.g., for max-width: 767px) can be added to enhance responsiveness.
HTML Structure:

The project uses semantic HTML elements like <section>, <header>, <article>, and <footer> for better accessibility and structure.

 
 

 ## My process
 
 ### Built with
 
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - CSS 
 - Flexbox
 - media queries
 ### What I learned
 
i am very proud of being able to use javascript to make my project functional. It took me a while to figure it out, but it was worth is, because it was part of the learning process.
 
 If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
 
 
 
 ### Continued development
 
 i realised i still struggle with responsive designs. This is something i am looking forward to improve in.
