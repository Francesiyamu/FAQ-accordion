 ## My process
 
 ### Built with
 
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - CSS 
 - Flexbox
 - media queries
 ### What I learned
 
i am very proud of being able to use javascript to make my project functional. It took me a while to figure it out, but it was worth is, because it was part of the learning process.
 
 If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
 
 
 
 ### Continued development
 
 i realised i still struggle with responsive designs. This is something i am looking forward to improve in.
